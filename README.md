# Advent of Code

My [Advent of Code](http://adventofcode.com) solutions in C++ starting from [2022](2022).

These solutions are very ugly, difficult to understand, probably unsafe, and terribly slow. They are written as quickly
as possible since I was participating in private leaderboards. I am sorry for the person that reads this code...
